"""
The script uses two given points and the distance formula to calculate
the distance between the two points on the image in pixels. To get the
real units, divide the distance by the image's width, resulting in a
number between 0 and 1, and multiply that number by the width of the
image in reality â€“ that is, the span of the rightmost and leftmost
pixels of the image in real life, like 30 centimeters or 2.3 miles.
